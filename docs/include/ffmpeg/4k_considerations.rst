Considerations for 4K Streams
***************************************************

The |SDK| solution supports real-time decoding and encoding of 4k streams with the following notes:

- The Xilinx video pipeline is optimized for live-streaming use cases. For 4k streams with bitrates significantly higher than the ones typically used for live streaming, it may not be possible to sustain real-time performance.
- Transcode pipelines split across two devices and decoding a 4K60 H.264 10-bit input stream will not perform at real-time speed.
- 4K60 encode-only and decode-only use cases involve significant transfers of raw data between the host and the device. This may impact the overall performance.
- When decoding 4k streams with a high bitrate, increasing the number of entropy buffers using the :option:`-entropy_buffers_count` option can help improve performance
- When encoding raw video to 4k, set the :option:`-s` option to ``3840x2160`` to specify the desired resolution.
- When encoding 4k streams to H.264, the :option:`-slices` option is required to sustain real-time performance. A value of 4 is recommended. This option is not required when encoding to HEVC.
