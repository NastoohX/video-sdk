Video Decoding
*********************************************************

For the complete list of features and capabilities of the Xilinx hardware decoder, refer to the :ref:`Video Codec Unit <video-codec-unit>` section of the :doc:`Specs and Features </specs_and_features>` chapter of the documentation.

The Xilinx video decoder is leveraged in FFmpeg by setting the :option:`-c:v` option to ``mpsoc_vcu_hevc`` for HEVC or to ``mpsoc_vcu_h264`` for H.264.

The table below describes all the options for the Xilinx video decoder.

====================================  ===========================
Options                               Descriptions
====================================  ===========================
.. option:: -low_latency              | Configure decoder to handle out-of-order frames in order to decrease the latency of the system.
                                      | IMPORTANT: This option should not be used when processing streams containing B frames. 
                                      | Valid values: 0 (default) and 1
.. option:: -entropy_buffers_count    | Specify number of internal entropy buffers.
                                      | Valid values: 2 (default) to 10
                                      | Can be used to improve the performance for input streams with a high bitrate (including 4k streams) or a high number of reference frames. 2 is enough for most cases. 5 is the practical limit.
.. option:: -splitbuff_mode           | Configure decoder in split/unsplit input buffer mode.
                                      | Valid values: 0 (default) and 1
