Using FFmpeg for Video Scaling on Alveo U30
*****************************************************

The Alveo U30 card provides hardware-accelerated video decoding, scaling, and encoding. Each device on an Alveo U30 card supports multiple input channels (raw or encoded) up to a total equivalent bandwidth of 4kp60. Using the Multiscale XMA FFmpeg plug-in included in the Xilinx Video SDK, each input channel can be scaled in hardware to multiple lower resolution and/or lower frame rate outputs.

The Xilinx Video SDK supports the following scaling features and capabilities:

- Up to 32 input streams of raw or encoded video can be scaled down per device
- Each input stream can be scaled down to a maximum of 8 outputs streams of lower resolution and/or lower frame rate
- Up to 32 scaled outputs streams are supported per device, up to a maximum total equivalent bandwidth of 4kp60
- The scaler supports spatial resolutions from 3840x2160 to 128x128, in multiples of 4 
- Scaled output streams can optionally be encoded to H.264 of HEVC, using the same codec for all streams
- The scaler passes scaled frames and meta data to the next scaling level (if one is defined) and to the encoder (if one is being used)
- Each level of scaling adds a little more latency to the pipeline

For additional details about the specification of the hardware scaler, refer to the :ref:`Adaptive Bitrate Scaler features <adaptive-bitrate-scaler>` section in the introductory chapter of this user guide. 

The figure below illustrates a scaling ladder with a 1920x1080 input and 4 outputs with resolutions of 1280x720, 852x480, 640x360, and 416x240, respectively.

**IMPORTANT:** The frame rate and resolution of a given output should be smaller or equal than the rate of the previous output. Since the output of one scaling stage is passed as an input to the next, visual quality will be negatively affected if frame rate is increased after it has been lowered.


Using the Alveo U30 Multiscale Filter
==========================================

This section describes the FFmpeg syntax to configure the scaler, create ABR ladders and use the corresponding output streams.

An ABR ladder is created using the FFmpeg :option:`-filter_complex` ``"<filter graph>"`` syntax. The filter graph specification should be constructed in the following way:

- Add the :option:`multiscale_xma` filter to the graph   
- Set the number of scaler outputs
- Set the width, height, and rate settings for each scaler output 
- Define the name each scaler output
- If the outputs are not to encoded on the device, add :option:`xvbm_convert` filters to the filter graph to reformat the pixels

The filter graph syntax must follow these rules:

- The entire filter graph sequence must be enclosed in quotes (``"``)
- Each option of the :option:`multiscale_xma` filter (outputs, width, height, rate) must be separated by a colon (``:``)
- A white space must separate the last :option:`multiscale_xma` option from the list of output names
- If :option:`xvbm_convert` filters must be added to the filter graph, they must be preceded by a semi-colon (``;``)
- The filter graph sequence should not end with  ``;"``

The FFmpeg ``-map`` command is used to map and use each scaled output stream. All options of the ``-map`` commands must be separated by white spaces. 
 
The following example shows a complete command to decode, scale and encode to two resolutions on device::

    ffmpeg -y -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -i 1080p60_input.mp4 \
        -filter_complex "multiscale_xma=outputs=2: \
        out_1_width=1280: out_1_height=720: out_1_rate=full: \
        out_2_width=640:  out_2_height=360: out_2_rate=half \
        [a][b]" \
        -map "[a]"       -b:v 3M    -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f mp4 -y 720p60.mp4 \
        -map "[b]" -r 30 -b:v 1250K -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f mp4 -y 360p30.mp4 

The following example shows a complete command to decode, scale and send two resolutions to the host for postprocessing::

    ffmpeg -y -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -i 1080p60_input \
        -filter_complex "multiscale_xma=outputs=2: \
        out_1_width=1280: out_1_height=720:  \
        out_2_width=640:  out_2_height=360 \
        [a][b]; [a]xvbm_convert[aa]; [b]xvbm_convert[bb]" \
        -map "[aa]" -f rawvideo -pix_fmt nv12 720p60.yuv \
        -map "[bb]" -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p 360p60.yuv 


Alveo U30 Multiscale Filter Options
==========================================

.. option:: multiscale_xma

  Filter implementing the Xilinx ABR multiscaler. Takes one input and up to 8 output streams. The complete list of options is described below.


.. list-table:: Multiscale Filter Options
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Options
     - Description
   * - .. option:: outputs    
     - | **Specify the number of scaler outputs** 
       | Valid values are integers between 1 and 8     
   * - .. option:: out_{N}_width
     - | **Specify the width of each of the scaler outputs**
       | The output number {N} must be an integer value between 1 and 8, and must not exceed the number of outputs specified with :option:`outputs`     
       | Valid values are integers between 3840 and 128, in multiples of 4  
       | The frame resolution of a given output should be smaller or equal than the resolution of the previous output
   * - .. option:: out_{N}_height
     - | **Specify the height of each of the scaler outputs**    
       | The output number {N} must be an integer value between 1 and 8, and must not exceed the number of outputs specified with :option:`outputs`     
       | Valid values are integers between 2160 and 128, in multiples of 4  
       | The frame resolution of a given output should be smaller or equal than the resolution of the previous output
   * - .. option:: out_{N}_rate
     - | **Specify the frame rate of each of the scaler outputs**
       | By default, the scaler uses the input stream frame rate for all outputs. While the encoder supports frame dropping with the -r option,
       | there is also hardware support in the scaler for dropping frames. Dropping frames in the scaler is preferred since it saves scaler
       | bandwidth, allowing the scaler and encoder to operate more efficiently.
       | The output number {N} must be an integer value between 1 and 8, and must not exceed the number of outputs specified with :option:`outputs`     
       | Valid values are ``full`` (default) and ``half``                 
       | The first output has to be full rate output (``out_1_rate=full``)
       | The frame rate of a given output should be smaller or equal than the resolution of the previous output.|


Encoding Scaler Outputs
=======================

The outputs of an ABR ladder can be encoded on the device using either the ``mpsoc_vcu_h264`` or the ``mpsoc_vcu_hevc`` codec. All outputs must be encoded using the same codec.

The following snippet shows how the desired codec is specified for each of the scaler outputs::

    ...
    -map "[a]" -b:v 4M    -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f mp4 720p60_output.mp4 \
    -map "[b]" -b:v 1500k -c:v mpsoc_vcu_h264 -f mp4 480p60_output.mp4 

A full example of a raw to encoded ABR ladder can be found here: :ref:`Encode Only Into Multiple Resolution Outputs <encode-only-multiple-res-outputs>`.


Using Raw Scaler Outputs
========================

To return raw video outputs from the ABR ladder, use the :option:`xvbm_convert` filter to copy the frames from the device to the host and set the desired pixel formal, as shown in this command snippet::

    ...
    [a]xvbm_convert[aa]; [b]xvbm_convert[bb]; \
    -map "[aa]" -f rawvideo -pix_fmt nv12    -y ./outdir/720p60_nv12.yuv \
    -map "[bb]" -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -y ./outdir/480p60_yuv420.yuv

Performance Considerations
==========================
Encoded input streams with a high bitrate or with a high number of reference frames can degrade the performance of an ABR ladder. The :option:`-entropy_buffers_count` decoder option can be used to help with this. A value of 2 is enough for most cases, 5 is the practical limit.
