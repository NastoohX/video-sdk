# Xilinx Video SDK Repository

</br>

Version: **1.0**

</br>

The Xilinx Video SDK is a complete software stack allowing users to seamlessly leverage the hardware accelerated features of Alveo U30 cards and enable high-density real-time transcoding for live streaming video service providers, OEMs, and Content Delivery Network (CDNs). 

Included in the Xilinx Video SDK is pre-compiled version of FFmpeg which integrates key video transcoding plug-ins, enabling simple hardware offloading of compute-intensive workloads using the popular FFmpeg command line interface. 

The Xilinx Video SDK also provides a C-based application programming interface (API) which facilitates the integration of Alveo U30 transcoding capabilities in proprietary frameworks.
