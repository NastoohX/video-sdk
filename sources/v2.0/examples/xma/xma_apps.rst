The examples in the ``examples/xma`` folder illustrate how C-based applications can natively interact with Xilinx devices using the |SDK| plugins and the XMA (Xilinx Media Accelerator) APIs. The examples are for advanced use-cases where using the FFmpeg command-line interface is not appropriate.

Detailed documentation on the |SDK| plugin interface and the XMA APIs can be found in the :doc:`C API Programming Guide </c_apis>` section of the documentation.

.. rubric:: Requirements

- The XMA applications has been built for and verified on Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, RHEL 7.8 and AWS Linux V2.
- The XMA applications only work with elementary streams. Container formats such as mp4 are not supported.

Build Instructions
****************************************************

.. rubric:: Pre-requisites

To build and test the XMA applications, the |SDK| packages must be installed on the server, and the Xilinx devices must to be flashed with the shell provided in the release package.

.. rubric:: Build

#. Export the XRT and XRM to build the xma apps::

    source /opt/xilinx/xcdr/setup.sh

#. Do make clean and make dev in the application directory::

    cd examples/xma
    make clean
    make dev

   The executables are placed in the ``Debug/xma_apps/examples`` directory.

#. Optional: to generate DEB and RPM packages for the XMA apps, run one of the two commands below::

    make DEB
    make RPM

.. rubric:: Test

The ``build_and_test.bash`` script included in the ``./examples/xma`` directory can be used to build and test all the XMA applications at once. This script sets up the environment, builds all the applications and then runs a simple test to validate that each of the applications works correctly. Run the script as follows::

    ./build_and_test.bash

To test each application individually, refer to the sections below.
